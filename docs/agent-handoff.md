# Agent Handoff

Use this file as the single coordination point for multi-agent work.

## Coordination Rules

- One owner agent at a time controls integration decisions.
- Each agent works in its own branch: `agent/<name>/<task>`.
- Before editing files, claim them in **Active File Locks**.
- Keep commits atomic and scoped to one logical change.
- Update this file at the start and end of each work burst.

## Current Owner

- Owner agent: GitHub Copilot
- Owner branch: main
- Since (UTC): 2026-02-27
- Ownership reason: Primary integration and merge coordination
