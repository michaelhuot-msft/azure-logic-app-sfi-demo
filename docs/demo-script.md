## Section 1: Problem Statement (0:00 - 2:00)

### What to say

> "Every day, your organization processes thousands of patient referrals. A cardiologist referral marked urgent can't wait in the same queue as a routine physical therapy follow-up. When urgent referrals get buried in a general queue, patients wait longer for critical care — and that's a compliance risk.
>
> Today I'm going to show you how Azure Logic Apps can automatically intake, validate, and route referrals by priority — with zero code, full HIPAA-aligned security controls, and a deployment that takes five minutes."

### Key points to emphasize

- Manual triage is error-prone and doesn't scale
- Missed urgent referrals = delayed care = liability
- This solution is fully automated, auditable, and runs at pennies per referral

---

## Section 2: Architecture Walkthrough (2:00 - 4:00)

### What to show

Open the architecture diagram (`docs/architecture.excalidraw` in Excalidraw, or show the Mermaid diagram from the README).

### What to say

> "Here's the end-to-end flow. A referral comes in as an API call — just like it would from your EHR system or a web portal.
>
> It hits **API Management** first — that's your front door. It handles authentication, rate limiting, and gives you a clean API contract.
>
> Behind that sits the **Intake Logic App**. It validates the referral against a schema — patient ID, diagnosis code, priority level — and enriches it with a correlation ID for tracking. Then it drops it on a **Service Bus queue**.
>
> A second **Router Logic App** picks up the message and checks the priority. Urgent and high-priority referrals go to one queue. Normal and low go to another. That's your triage — automated, consistent, instant.
>
> Underneath all of this: **Key Vault** for secrets management, **Managed Identity** so there are zero passwords in the code, and **Log Analytics** capturing every action for your compliance team."

### Key points to emphasize

- Two-stage pipeline pattern (intake vs. routing) for separation of concerns
- Managed Identity means zero credential management
- Every component logs to a centralized workspace

## Section 3: Show the Code (4:00 - 6:00)

### What to show

Open `main.bicep` in VS Code or a code viewer.

### What to say

> "The entire infrastructure is defined in Bicep — Azure's Infrastructure-as-Code language. This is the main orchestrator file. It calls nine modules in the right dependency order.
>
> *(Scroll through the module calls)*
>
> Each module is focused: one for Service Bus, one for Key Vault, one for each Logic App. The Logic Apps define their workflows right in the Bicep template — the trigger, the validation schema, the routing logic — it's all here, version-controlled, reviewable.
>
> *(Open `modules/logic-app-intake.bicep`, scroll to the schema section around line 40)*
>
> Here's the referral schema. Six required fields: patient ID, name, referral type, priority, diagnosis code, and referring provider. If any of these are missing, the Logic App rejects it immediately with a 400 error. No bad data gets into the pipeline.
>
> *(Open `modules/logic-app-router.bicep`, scroll to Check_Priority around line 60)*
>
> And here's the routing logic — a simple condition: if priority is urgent or high, route to the urgent queue. Everything else goes to standard. Clean and auditable."

### Key points to emphasize

- Everything is Infrastructure-as-Code — no Portal click-ops
- Schema validation catches bad data at the front door
- Routing logic is transparent and version-controlled

---

## Section 4: Deployment (6:00 - 8:00)

### What to show

Azure Portal — Resource Group view showing all deployed resources.

### What to say

> "I deployed this environment earlier using a single PowerShell command. Let me show you what it created.
>
> *(Navigate to: Portal > Resource Groups > rg-healthcare-referral-demo)*
>
> You can see nine resources here: API Management, two Logic Apps, Service Bus with three queues, Key Vault, Log Analytics, and the API connection.
>
> *(Click into the Service Bus namespace, show the three queues)*
>
> Three queues: incoming referrals — that's the intake buffer. Urgent referrals and standard referrals — those are the routed outputs.
>
> The entire deployment takes about five to six minutes. One command, one parameter file, fully repeatable."

### Portal navigation

1. Portal Home > Resource Groups > `rg-healthcare-referral-demo`
2. Click the Service Bus namespace > Queues blade
3. Show the three queues: `incoming-referrals`, `urgent-referrals`, `standard-referrals`

### If asked about deployment time

> "API Management Consumption tier deploys in about two minutes. If we used the Developer tier, that alone would take 30-40 minutes. Consumption is the right choice for demos and low-volume workloads."

---

## Section 5: Live Test (8:00 - 11:00)

### What to do

Run the test script from terminal. This is the highlight of the demo — take your time here.

### What to say and do

> "Now let's see it work. I'm going to send three referrals through the system."

**Paste and run:**
```powershell
./test-referral.ps1 -ApiEndpoint "<YOUR_ENDPOINT>" -SubscriptionKey "<YOUR_KEY>"
```

**Test 1 fires — urgent cardiology:**

> "First referral: Sarah Mitchell, urgent cardiology. She has atherosclerotic heart disease — ICD code I25.10 — with exertional dyspnea. This needs to get to a cardiologist fast.
>
> *(Point to the 202 Accepted and correlation ID in the output)*
>
> Accepted. The system gave us back a correlation ID — that's our tracking number across the entire pipeline."

*(3-second pause — script handles this automatically)*

**Test 2 fires — normal PT:**

> "Second referral: David Chen, normal priority physical therapy for low back pain. Routine, not urgent.
>
> *(Point to the 202 Accepted)*
>
> Also accepted. But this one will go to a different queue."

*(3-second pause)*

**Test 3 fires — invalid payload:**

> "Third test: I'm intentionally sending bad data — missing required fields.
>
> *(Point to the 400 Bad Request)*
>
> Rejected. A 400 error. The schema validation caught it before it ever reached the queue. No garbage in the pipeline."

### Now show the Portal results

> "Let's go to the Portal and see what happened behind the scenes."

**Navigate to Intake Logic App:**

1. Portal > Resource Groups > `rg-healthcare-referral-demo`
2. Click the intake Logic App (`hlth-dev-*-intake`)
3. Click **Run history** in the left nav

> "Three runs. Two succeeded — those are our valid referrals. One failed — that's the validation rejection. Exactly what we expected."

*(Click on a succeeded run to show the workflow visualization)*

> "Here you can see each step: the HTTP trigger received the payload, the Compose action enriched it with a correlation ID and timestamp, and then it was sent to the incoming queue. Green checkmarks all the way."

**Navigate to Router Logic App:**

1. Back to resource group
2. Click the router Logic App (`hlth-dev-*-router`)
3. Click **Run history**

> "The router picked up both messages. Let's look at one."

*(Click on a run, show the If/Else branch)*

> "See the condition check? It evaluated the priority field, determined this was urgent, and routed it to the urgent-referrals queue. The other run took the else branch and went to standard."

**Navigate to Service Bus queues:**

1. Back to resource group
2. Click Service Bus namespace
3. Click **Queues**

> "And here's the final proof: urgent-referrals has one message, standard-referrals has one message. Sarah Mitchell went urgent, David Chen went standard. Automated triage in milliseconds."

## Section 6: Observability (11:00 - 13:00)

### What to show

Open the Grafana dashboard (URL from deploy output, or opened by `demo-helper.ps1`).

### What to say and do

> "Now let me show you the operational dashboard. This is Azure Managed Grafana — it's connected directly to our Log Analytics workspace and Azure Monitor metrics. The deployment created this dashboard automatically."

*(Navigate to the Healthcare Referral Routing dashboard)*

> "At the top, four summary panels: total referrals received, urgent count, standard count, and validation errors. Right now we can see the three referrals we just sent — one urgent, one standard, one rejected.
>
> *(Point to the time series panels)*
>
> These charts show intake and router Logic App runs over time — green bars for successes, red for failures. In production with hundreds of referrals per hour, you'd see the throughput pattern here instantly.
>
> *(Point to the queue message flow panel)*
>
> This tracks messages flowing through each Service Bus queue. You can see exactly when messages arrived in incoming, and when they were routed to urgent and standard.
>
> *(Point to the active messages bar gauge)*
>
> Active messages per queue — this is your backlog indicator. If urgent-referrals starts building up, someone needs to know. You could set a Grafana alert to fire when this exceeds a threshold.
>
> *(Point to the recent activity table)*
>
> And at the bottom, a live activity feed — every workflow run with its status and tracking ID. Your compliance team gets this view without writing a single query."

### Why Grafana instead of just KQL?

If asked:

> "Log Analytics is powerful, but it requires writing KQL queries. Grafana gives you a visual dashboard that updates in real time — much better for ops teams and executives who need a glance, not a query language. And because it's Azure Managed Grafana, there's nothing to install or maintain."

### Fallback — if Grafana data is sparse

If Log Analytics hasn't ingested enough data yet:

> "Diagnostic data takes 5-10 minutes to appear on first run. Let me show you what this looks like with the raw KQL query in Log Analytics."

**Switch to Log Analytics:**
1. Back to resource group > Log Analytics workspace > Logs
2. Paste this query:
```kql
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.LOGIC"
| where Category == "WorkflowRuntime"
| project TimeGenerated, resource_workflowName_s, status_s, correlation_clientTrackingId_s
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| take 20
```

> "This is the same data powering the Grafana dashboard — timestamped, with the workflow name, status, and correlation ID for end-to-end tracking."

## Section 7: Extensibility & Cost (13:00 - 15:00)

### What to say

> "What I showed you today is a starting point. Here's where you can take it:
>
> **Teams or email alerts** — Add a Logic App action to send a Teams notification when an urgent referral is received. It's one extra step in the workflow.
>
> **FHIR integration** — The referral schema is already FHIR-like. You can swap the HTTP trigger for an Azure FHIR Server event, or add a step to write back to your EHR.
>
> **ML-based triage** — Replace the simple if/else with an Azure ML model that scores referral urgency based on clinical notes and diagnosis history.
>
> **Multi-region** — Service Bus supports geo-disaster recovery. You can replicate this across regions for high availability."

### Cost discussion

> "On cost: API Management Consumption tier bills per call — about three fifty per million. Logic Apps charge per action — fractions of a cent. Service Bus Standard is about ten dollars a month base.
>
> For a hospital processing a thousand referrals a day, you're looking at **under fifty dollars a month**. Compare that to the cost of a missed urgent referral."

### Cleanup

> "And when you're done, one command tears everything down:
>
> `az group delete --name rg-healthcare-referral-demo --yes --no-wait`
>
> Every resource, gone. No orphaned infrastructure, no surprise bills."

### Closing

> "To summarize: we took a real healthcare problem — referral triage — and solved it with a fully automated, HIPAA-aligned pipeline that deploys in five minutes, costs pennies to run, and gives your compliance team a complete audit trail. All Infrastructure-as-Code, all version-controlled, all repeatable."

## Q&A Prompts

If the audience is quiet, prompt with:

- "What does your current referral workflow look like today?"
- "How are you handling urgent vs. routine prioritization currently?"
- "What compliance requirements does your team need to satisfy for referral data?"
- "Are there other workflows beyond referrals that follow this same pattern — intake, validate, route?"

## Recovery Tips

| Issue | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| **Test script returns 401** | Subscription key may be wrong. Re-run `demo-helper.ps1` to get the correct key. |
| **Test script returns 404** | APIM may still be deploying. Wait 1-2 minutes and retry. |
| **Logic App runs don't appear** | Runs take a few seconds to show. Refresh the Portal page. |
| **Router hasn't processed messages** | The router polls every 30 seconds. Wait up to a minute, then refresh. |
| **Log Analytics shows no data** | Ingestion takes 5-10 minutes on first run. Use Service Bus metrics as a fallback. |
| **APIM returns 429 (rate limited)** | Wait 60 seconds — the rate limit is 10 calls per minute. |
| **Portal is slow** | Use Portal keyboard shortcuts: `G + /` to search for resources. |
